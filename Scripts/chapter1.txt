The door opens and a man walks in. He’s wearing an oversized brown trench coat and round glasses that sit too low on his nose. His left arm is in a cast.

Bryan, “Good evening. Do you know where the bank is?”

“Two blocks to the right. It’s closed right now, though.”

Bryan, “No worries, I only needed the directions.”

You point to the menu. “Would you like to order anything?”

Bryan eyes a specific line in interest. “What does that mean?”

You explain that the special perk of this cafe is that the barista makes the coffee based on the customer’s mood. You analyze Bryan and make a personalized drink for him. The tutorial begins.

Option 1: “Are you new here?”
Option 2: “Is your arm okay?”

*
Bryan 1: “Yes. I live in Seatown. It’s fifty something miles from here.”
You’ve never heard of Seatown before. “What’s it like?”
Bryan 1: “Cozy. Everyone knows each other, everyone attends the same events, faces the same hardships and joys.”
You smile. That does sound nice.
*
*
Bryan 2: “It’ll be alright.”
You: “Do you need to see a doctor?”
Bryan 2: “Don’t worry, the doctor in my hometown fixed me up good.”
You: “Where is your hometown?”
Bryan 2: “Seatown. Great place. About fifty miles from here.”
You’ve never heard of Seatown before.

You give Bryan the coffee and he seems quite happy with it.

Bryan, “You know, I’m also here looking for a young woman named Ophelia.”

You rack your mind to put a face to the name but to no avail. “Sorry, never heard her before.”

Bryan, “Hmm, that’s odd. She’s a big fan of coffee if I remember correctly.”

#
Option 1: “What does she look like?”
Option 2: “How do you know her?”
*
Bryan 1: “Blonde hair, average height, likes to wear a cap. It’s strange how she hasn’t stopped by yet.”
	You: “Are you two related or something?”
Bryan 1: “Oh no, we’re just old friends. I was her guardian for a time before we parted ways.”
*
*
Bryan 2: “We’re old friends. I was her guardian for a time before we had to part ways. I haven’t seen her in… let’s see… oh, it’s been too long.”
You: “What does she look like?”
Bryan 2: ““Blonde hair, average height, likes to wear a cap. It’s strange how she hasn’t stopped by yet.”

You: “I’ll let you know if she does stop by.”

Bryan, “Alright, but remember that she hates black coffee. She might ask for it, but don’t you dare give it to her.”

“Okay then.”

The room falls into silence for a few minutes, and all the customers listen quietly to the music playing in the background. Meanwhile, you fix another customer a drink. //This time it’s milk tea with one tablespoon of sugar and no ice.

You walk to Bryan and ask him: “You said you are from somewhere fifty miles from here?”

Bryan: “Yes, so I occasionally get to go back.”
